## References

- Use `const` for all of your references; avoid using `var`. 
  > Why? This ensures that you can't reassign your references, which can lead to bugs and difficult to comprehend code.

  ```javascript
  // bad
  var a = 1;
  var b = 2;

  // good
  const a = 1;
  const b = 2;
  ```


- If you must reassign references, use `let` instead of `var`. 
  > Why? `let` is block-scoped rather than function-scoped like `var`.
  > In any case, if you have to use `let`, think twice, there's always a way of doing things without mutation.

  ```javascript
  // bad
  var count = 1;
  if (true) {
    count += 1;
  }

  // less bad, use the let.
  let count = 1;
  if (true) {
    count += 1;
  }
  ```
