## Pitfalls


- Discourage the use of the `for ... in` statement, if used it has to be filtered with an if statement.

  ```ts
  for (let key in object) {
    if (object.hasOwnProperty(key))
  }
  ```

  > Prevents accidental iteration over properties inherited from an object’s prototype. See [MDN’s `for...in`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) documentation for more information about for...in loops.

  > If you plan to use a `for...in` think twice, this structure favour mutabiliy. Consider usin `Object.keys`, `Object.values` or `Object.attributes` followed by high order array function like `map` or `reduce`.

  > The usage of `for...in` in arrays can cause unexpected behaviour. `for...in` will iterate over the indices of the array as strings, omitting any “holes” in the array.

- Ban bitwise operators

  > Specifically, the following bitwise operators are banned: &, &=, |, |=, ^, ^=, <<, <<=, >>, >>=, >>>, >>>=, and ~. This rule does not ban the use of & and | for intersection and union types.

  > Bitwise operators are often typos - for example bool1 & bool2 instead of bool1 && bool2. They also can be an indicator of overly clever code which decreases maintainability.


---


- Do not use conditional assignments

  > Assignments in conditionals are often typos: for example if (var1 = var2) instead of if (var1 == var2). They also can be an indicator of overly clever code which decreases maintainability.


---


- Do not use null

  > Instead of having the dual concepts of null andundefined in a codebase, this rule ensures that only undefined is used.


---


- No shadowing

  > Shadowing a variable masks access to it and obscures to what value an identifier actually refers.

---


- Do not throw strings

  > Flags throwing plain strings or concatenations of strings because only Errors produce proper stack traces.
